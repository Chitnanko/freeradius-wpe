Update 8/15/2012: 

	Housekeeeping:
	I decided to Remove the versioning from the patch name. This way I 
	can just update the github and maintain a constant download location.
	This README will define what version the patch is for. 

	Changes:
	+Added john NETNTLM formated output
	+Readded PAP and EAP-MD5 support
	+Fixed a problem when using MSCHAPv1 (issue 1 on github)

Install:

	From Source:
	
	wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/freeradius/freeradius-server-2.1.12.tar.bz2

	Over time, if a newer version of freeradius comes out, this link will change to:

	wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/old/freeradius-server-2.1.12.tar.bz2

	wget https://raw.github.com/brad-anton/freeradius-wpe/master/freeradius-wpe.patch

	tar -jxvf freeradius-server-2.1.12.tar.bz2
	cd freeradius-server-2.1.12
	patch -p1 < ../freeradius-wpe.patch

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

	You may also have to:
	cd /usr/local/etc/raddb/certs/
	./bootstrap

	---

	Using Binary:

	If you're using the .deb, it has been tested with BackTrack 5 R2, but will likely work with other versions and Ubuntu/Debian. 

	wget https://github.com/brad-anton/freeradius-wpe/raw/master/freeradius-server-wpe_2.1.12-1_i386.deb

	sudo dpkg --install freeradius-server-wpe_2.1.12-1_i386.deb
	sudo ldconfig 

        You may also have to:
        cd /usr/local/etc/raddb/certs/
        ./bootstrap

	and just to confirm:
	radiusd -v
	
	make sure it says:
	radiusd: FreeRADIUS-WPE Version 2.1.12

Usage:
	
	Run "radiusd" and direct an access point to the server. Once a client connects 
	freeradius-wpe will store the credentials in:
	
	/usr/local/var/log/radius/freeradius-server-wpe.log
	
	by default, otherwise you can define an alternative location using "wpelogfile"
	config option.

	Depending on the EAP Type and inner auth. creds used, the info in the log file
	might be plaintext or encrypted. Most likely it'll be MSCHAPv2, if it is, 
	you'll need to crack those credentials with asleap or john, or something else. 
	

	If you don't want to use a hardware access point, you can use hostapd. Here is a
	sample hostapd.conf that will set up an AP and direct it to FreeRADIUS-WPE 
	be sure to run "radiusd" first.
